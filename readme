This is a quick app to estimate the current frequency of tweets about a particular subject

It searches twitter for a term and stores:
   a) the current time
   b) the number of tweets returned (limted to 25)
   c) the time spanned by these tweets

... which lets you work out a rough idea of how frequently it is being mentioned

Config:
   - httparty & sinatra gems 
   - list your terms in _terms.txt (term logs are named based on line numbers, so be sure to append, not edit, this file)

There are two parts to the app:

1. Capture

ruby capture.rb
   - this will search twitter for the terms in the _terms.txt file.

2. Server

ruby server.rb
   - this launches a sintra app which lists the terms, the number of times they have been queried and gives a link to the relevant log file
